Number

    ARB Extension #179

Dependencies

    This extension is written against OpenGL 4.5 (CoreProfile) dated
    May 28 2015.

Overview

    Compiling GLSL into implementation-specific code can be a time consuming
    process, so a GL implementation may wish to perform the compilation in a
    separate CPU thread. This extension provides a mechanism for the application
    to provide a hint to limit the number of threads it wants to be used to
    compile shaders, as well as a query to determine if the compilation process
    is complete.

New Procedures and Functions

    void MaxShaderCompilerThreadsARB(uint count);

New Tokens

    Accepted by the <pname> parameter of GetBooleanv, GetIntegerv,
    GetInteger64v, GetFloatv, and GetDoublev:

        MAX_SHADER_COMPILER_THREADS_ARB   0x91B0

    Accepted as part of the <pname> parameter to GetShaderiv() and
    accepted as part of the <pname> parameter to GetProgramiv():

        COMPLETION_STATUS_ARB             0x91B1

IP Status

    None.

Additions to Chapter 7 "Programs and Shaders",

    Append to the end of 7.1 "Shader Objects",

        Application may use the following to hint to the driver the maximum
    number background threads it would like to be used in the process of
    compiling shaders or linking programs,

        void MaxShaderCompilerThreadsARB(uint count);

    where <count> is the number of background threads. A <count> of zero
    specifies a request for no parallel compiling or linking and a <count> of
    0xFFFFFFFF requests an implementation-specific maximum.

    An implementation may combine the maximum compiler thread request from
    multiple contexts in a share group in an implementation-specific way.

    An application can query the current MaxShaderCompilerThreads() <count>
    by calling GetIntegerv with <pname> set to MAX_SHADER_COMPILER_THREADS.


    Add to 7.13 "Shader, Program, and Program Pipeline Queries" under the
    descriptions for "pname" for "GetShaderiv()",

        If <pname> is COMPLETION_STATUS, FALSE is returned if the shader is
        currently being compiled by a background thread, TRUE otherwise.

    Add to 7.13 "Shader, Program, and Program Pipeline Queries" under the
    descriptions for "pname" for "GetProgramiv()",

        If <pname> is COMPLETION_STATUS, FALSE is returned if the program is
        currently being linked by a background thread, TRUE otherwise.

New State

    Add to Table 23.51: Hints
    Get Value                        Type  Get Command   Initial Value  Description           Sec
    ---------------------------      ----  ------------  -------------  --------------------  ----
    MAX_SHADER_COMPILER_THREADS_ARB  Z+    GetIntegerv   0xFFFFFFFF     Max compile threads   7.13

    Add to Table 23.32: Program Object State
    Get Value                    Type  Get Command   Initial Value  Description           Sec
    ---------------------------  ----  ------------  -------------  --------------------  ----
    COMPLETION_STATUS_ARB        B     GetProgramiv  TRUE           Program is not being  7.13
                                                                    compiled in parallel

    Add to Table 23.30: Shader Object State
    Get Value                    Type  Get Command   Initial Value  Description           Sec
    ---------------------------  ----  ------------  -------------  --------------------  ----
    COMPLETION_STATUS_ARB        B     GetShaderiv   TRUE           Shader is not being  7.13
                                                                    linked in parallel
Issues

    1) Where should the hint state be stored?

    UNRESOLVED: Each context has its own value which may be specified and
    queried, but an implementation may choose to combine the hints from multiple
    contexts in an implmentation-specific manner. There isn't really any
    precedent for per-share group state.

    2) Can we make the requirements more strict?

    RESOLVED: We could, but making sure all of the error behavior is correct and
    fully specified would likely take more time than we have. This spec allows
    an application to clearly request its intent even if there aren't guarantees
    that the implementation will exactly obey the request.
